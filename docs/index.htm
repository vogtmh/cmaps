            - New LDAP API: sync has been rewritten from scratch, offering more functionality and a consistent user experience for our admins.<br />
            - Some companies grow bigger than expected. To provide more scalability, the LDAP sync is now able to fetch data of up to 26.000 people.<br />
            - Slack notifications now are bundled into a single message per sync, so you don't get spammed any more.<br />

            - Introducing mobile mode (preview): a new UI for smaller devices like smartphones and tablets to assist you on the go.<br />
            - Overlapping labels do not really help. That's why peoples names are now hidden when displaying teams.<br />
            - As more and more locations were added, the map selection sometimes grew out of the screen. It will now split into two columns if it gets too long.<br />
            - In some cases the URL with all its parameters blocked the workflow. In will now be reset to the base URL to keep everything running smoothly.<br />
            - Added customization options for logo and apptitle via database (relevant for admins only)<br />

            2019-12-03: Version 4.0<br /><br />
            - Part-time employees and students are important to us - so every desk now supports up to 4 people to make them visible!<br />
            - The database has been redesigned and all items are now properly identified by an extra attribute instead of using some strange algorithm.<br />
            - Search engine has been rewritten in pure JavaScript to fully rely on the APIs introduced in Version 3.x - hyper speed, less network load!<br />
            - Because R&D loves funny team names: Searching for people now also highlights the teams they are part of.<br/> 
            - Update triggers have been fine-tuned to run less often and save your battery for more important tasks.<br />
            - Leading and trailing whitespaces will be automatically removed from your search now, because nobody should care of invisible typos.<br />
            - The admin dashboard now uses JavaScript to refresh. Finally no more page reloading.<br/>
            - Many useless bugs have been kicked out of the house to make your stay more enjoyable.<br /><br />
          
            <p style="font-size:1.2em;">Version 3:</p>
            2019-10-05: Version 3.4<br /><br />
            - Changes to database scheme to simplify desktypes for v4<br />
            - Code cleanup for easier readability<br />
            - All update timers (notications, desks, meetings...) reduced to optimize power usage<br />

            - Fixed: Hover on mapflag is now always on top<br /><br />
            2019-09-18: Version 3.3<br /><br />
            - Copy-to-clipboard now uses a fadeout dialog box - saves you one click that can be used somewhere more meaningful ;-)<br />
            - Copy-to-clipboard is now possible for whole maps from the overview, too<br />
            - Dismiss location info now by clicking anywhere on the overview map<br />
            - Fixed: Adding new maps with upper case letters could cause problems on database<br />
            - Fixed: Zoom effect on overview map could cause blurry items on Safari<br />
            - Fixed: On Safari, fonts for smaller items on the overview appeared too large<br /><br />
            2019-09-14: Version 3.2<br /><br />
            - Overview has been completely redesigned with new map, detail view on locations and scalable icons<br />
            - New feature: Get direct links to people! Click on a desk to stick it and use the copy icon :-)<br />

            Printer status has been added<br />
            - See availability and cadridge status (if available)<br />
            - Stick it to get a link to the configuration page<br /><br />
            Drag and drop for edit mode (admins only)<br />
            - Click on a desk to edit its properties as before<br />
            - Move a desk to a new position directly<br /><br />
